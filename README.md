Anagraphs, the new word game by the creator of Synonymy, is an anagram finding game with a twist: It uses a special font where several letters are vertically symmetrical. The game is published by educational non-profit <a href="https://www.cinqmarsmedia.com">Cinq-Mars Media</a> and is available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1537359369">iOS</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1537359369">Android</a> free.

# Getting Started
We recommend downloading Node v10.24.1 or switching to it via NVM. Later versions of node will not work. Download the codebase, cd into the directory and run "npm ci". 

Then running "./node_modules/@ionic/app-scripts/bin/ionic-app-scripts.js serve" should launch the project on localhost. 


# Adding CSV Data

For the sake of space and distribution issues, the repo only comes with one stock, MSFT. To add more, you can find others online or generate dummy data. Add them to src/assets/stocks with the ticker in the title, and then add this ticker to the variable "activeTickers" in constants.ts
